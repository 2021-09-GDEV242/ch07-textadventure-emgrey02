For B level:
- add items to game
- make it so rooms can hold multiple items
- add Player that can carry one or more items

For A level:
- locked doors and keys
- eat changes game state
- non-player characters with items for trade
- rudimentary health system

I failed to include discrete commits...
but features in my project:
- implement an item
- allow player to take item
- allow player to drop item
- implement collection of items as inventory so player may have multiple items
- add inventory to room so room can hold multiple items
- add weight to items so player can only carry specified weight
- player can trade with ghost
- by trading, player removes ghost from house
- if all ghosts are removed, player wins
- if player loses all of their health, player loses.
